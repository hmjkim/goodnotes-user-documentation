## Convert Handwritten Math Equations

1. **Open an Existing or New Notebook**  
   ![Open Notebook](./assets/ai/open-notebook.png)  
   Launch the GoodNotes app and choose the notebook you want to use.

    !!! warning "Warning"
        Make sure you have enough space or a blank page for writing the equation.

2. **Write a Mathematical Expression**  
   ![Write an Equation](./assets/ai/write-equation.png)  
   We are going to try simple addition. In the empty space you have, write down `354 + 674 =`.

    !!! warning "Warning"
        GoodNotes cannot interpret an equation if you miss adding an `=` sign. For instance, `5 - 2` without an equals sign may not be detected.

    !!! tip "Tip"
    Imagine your math assignment asking you to express the answer in different formats. GoodNotes gives you options! You can convert `3/2` into a mixed fraction (`1 1/2`) or a decimal (`1.5`).

3. **Wait for the Equation to Be Highlighted**  
   GoodNotes automatically identifies your handwritten equation and highlights it in light blue. The highlight will slowly flash to indicate further action.

4. **Select “Solve”**  
   ![Solve Equation](./assets/ai/solve-equation.png)  
   Tap the highlighted equation and choose **Solve**. GoodNotes will compute and display the result.

   !!! note "Note"
   You also have other options. You can edit, copy, or even convert it into typed text.

5. **Write Over the Computed Answer**  
   ![Write Over Answer](./assets/ai/write-over-answer.png)  
   The computed answer appears in blue. Simply write over it if you want to replace it with your own text.

    !!! note "Note"
        The suggested answer remains visible until GoodNotes detects new writing. Once you start writing or move on, it disappears.

    !!! success "Success"
        Your equation is now solved! Enjoy referencing or customizing the computed result as needed.


## Search Your Own Handwriting for Keywords

1. **Open or Create a Notebook**  
   ![Open or Create Notebook](./assets/ai/open-or-create.png)  
   Ensure the notebook has some handwritten text you want to search.

2. **Write a Keyword**  
   ![Write Keyword](./assets/ai/write-keyword.png)  
   For example, write “midterm” to mark important exam topics.

3. **Tap the Search Icon**  
   ![Search Icon](./assets/ai/search-icon.png)  
   In the toolbar, tap **Search**. Then type or handwrite your keyword.

    !!! tip "Tip"
        You can use your Apple Pencil or stylus to write directly into the search bar.

4. **Review the Search Results**  
   GoodNotes displays page thumbnails with your keyword highlighted.  
   - Select the page you want to open.  
   - Toggle between **Notes** and **Outlines** to refine your search.


## Use Real-Time Grammar Correction

1. **Open Any Notebook**  
   ![Open Notebook](./assets/ai/open-notebook.png)  
   Continue in the same notebook or create a new one.

2. **Write a Commonly Misspelled Word**  
   ![Misspelled Word](./assets/ai/misspell-word.png)  
   For instance, “Recive” instead of “Receive.” GoodNotes underlines the misspelled word in red.

3. **Tap the Underlined Word to See Suggestions**  
   ![Grammar Suggestions](./assets/ai/grammar-suggestions.png)  
   Choose the correct spelling to replace it.

    !!! warning "Warning"
        Extremely stylized handwriting may not be recognized. Write as clearly as possible for the best results.
