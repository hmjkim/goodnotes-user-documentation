# Troubleshooting Guide

| Symptom  | Possible Cause    | Solution            |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Notebook not saving properly | Mandatory fields not filled, network issues, or iCloud sync error. | Verify all mandatory fields (e.g., Notebook Name) are filled in, ensure a stable network and active iCloud sync, then restart the app. |
| Cover design not displaying correctly | Unsupported image format or template issue. | Confirm that the image file format is supported; try selecting a different cover template or re-import your custom cover; check for app updates. |
| Paper template issues | Incompatible template or misconfiguration in settings. | Ensure you choose a compatible template, re-select it in the settings and confirm the preview before saving; restart the app if necessary. |
| App freezing during customization | Performance issues or outdated macOS. | Close and reopen the GoodNotes app, update macOS, or reinstall the app after backing up your data. |
| Settings not retained after saving | Incomplete save process, iCloud sync error, or software bug. | Double-check that you clicked the “Create” button, verify iCloud synchronization, and if the problem persists, recreate the notebook or contact GoodNotes support. |
