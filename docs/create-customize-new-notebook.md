   When you open the GoodNotes 6 app, you'll see an empty `Documents` page that serves as your homepage. From here, you can start creating new notebooks and folders.

   > **NOTE:** The Documents page is the default starting point. Familiarize yourself with its layout before proceeding.

2. **Click the ‘+’ Icon**

   Select the “NOTEBOOK” option from the top menu. The app offers several options, such as creating a study set, folder, image note, scanned document, quick note, or quick record.

3. **Configure Notebook Settings**

   Set up your notebook by adjusting the following:
   - **Name:** Enter the notebook title.
   - **Language:** Select your preferred language.
   - **Cover Toggle:** Choose whether to include a cover.

   > **IMPORTANT:** Be sure to set your desired language and cover toggle now, as these settings might be difficult to change later.

4. **Choose a Cover Design**

   Pick a cover design from the provided templates. You can also import your own cover templates or visit the marketplace to purchase one that suits your style. Each template offers a unique color palette, and you have options for different sizes (such as A4 or Letter).

   > **TIP:** A well-chosen cover can help you visually organize your notebooks. Consider creating a custom design if none of the templates match your style.

   *Example: Notebook Name – COMM 2216*

5. **Select a Paper Template**

   Choose an interior paper template for your notebook. Options include essentials, lined paper, music sheets, and planners. You may also import your own template or search for one that meets your needs.

   > **NOTE:** The paper template you choose will influence the overall feel of your notebook pages, so select one that best fits your intended use.

6. **Save the Notebook**

   Click the **“Create”** button to save your new notebook.

   > **IMPORTANT:** Once you click “Create,” some settings may become less flexible. Review your configuration carefully before saving.

## Notebook Customization

Personalize your notebook further by adjusting settings like scrolling direction, toolbar layout, stylus palm rejection, and sensitivity.
