## Create a New Notebook

1. **Launch the App**
![Initial Screen](./assets/notebook/documents-view.jpg)
   When you open the GoodNotes 6 app, you'll see an empty Documents page that acts as your home screen. From here, you can begin creating new notebooks and folders in the [Documents] section.

    !!! note "Note"
        The Documents page is your default starting point. Take a moment to get familiar with its layout before you continue.

2. **Click the [+] Icon**

        If you plan to add notes right away, choose the option that best fits your needs.

3. **Configure Notebook Settings**

   Set up your notebook by adjusting these options:
      - [Name]: Enter the notebook title.
      - [Language]: Choose your preferred language.
      - [Cover Toggle]: Decide whether to include a cover.

        Make sure you enter the notebook name correctly, select the right language, and set the cover toggle as you want because these settings may be hard to change later.

        A good cover not only makes your notebook look nice but also helps you keep it organized. Consider creating your own design if the default templates don’t match your taste.
