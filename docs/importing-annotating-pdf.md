    !!! note "Note"
        Customize your pen settings to match your writing style for optimal results.

## Annotate the Document
   Use the active annotation tools to mark up your document: Write, highlight, or underline text as needed.

1. **Add Bookmarks**  
![Bookmark](./assets/notebook/bookmark-in-notebook.png)
   Tap the bookmark icon (represented by a ribbon) on the toolbar to bookmark the current page.

   ![Bookmark](./assets/notebook/view-bookmark.png)
   To view or manage bookmarks, open the bookmark sidebar, where all your bookmarks are listed.

2. **View and Add Outlines**  
![outline](./assets/notebook/outline-selection.png)
   If your imported PDF includes a built-in outline, GoodNotes will display it in the sidebar.  
   ![outline](./assets/notebook/outline-editting.png)
   If no outline exists, you can manually create one by using the text tool to add a table of contents or annotating a dedicated page to serve as your custom outline.
     

    !!! tip "Tip"
        Using different colors or pen types for bookmarks and outline entries can help differentiate them and improve document navigation.
