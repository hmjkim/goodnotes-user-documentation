# Import and Annotate a PDF Document


## Overview
This section guides you through the process of importing a PDF document into GoodNotes and annotating it. This feature is ideal for students, professionals, or anyone who needs to mark up documents effectively.


## Import a PDF Document

There are two methods to import a PDF:

### Method 1: Import into an Existing Notebook

1. **Open an Existing Notebook**  
   Launch the GoodNotes app and open the notebook where you want to add the PDF.
   
   > **Note:** Ensure the notebook is set up and organized before importing a new document.

2. **Add a New Page**  
   Click the **Add Icon** (located at the top-right) to add a new page.

3. **Select the Insertion Point**  
   Choose whether to insert the new page before, after, or at the end of the notebook.
   
   > **Tip:** Selecting the correct insertion point helps maintain the document's flow.

4. **Choose the “Import” Option**  
   In the menu that appears, select the **“Import”** option.

### Method 2: Import as a New Document

1. **Click the ‘+’ Icon**  
   On the home screen, click the **‘+’** icon to create a new document.

2. **Select the “Import” Option**  
   Tap the **“Import”** button from the menu.
   
   > **Tip:** Importing as a new document creates a standalone PDF file, ideal for dedicated storage.

### Continue the Import Process

5. **Choose a File to Import**  
   Navigate through your file explorer and select the desired PDF file.

6. **Tap “Open”**  
   Confirm your selection by tapping **“Open”**.  
   
   > **Success:** Your PDF has been imported and is now ready for annotation.

## Activate Annotation Tools

7. **Activate Annotation Tools**  
   From the top menu, select tools such as **Pen**, **Highlighter**, or **Eraser**.

8. **Adjust Pen Settings**  
   Choose your preferred pen type (fountain pen, ballpoint, or brush pen) and enable stroke stabilization if needed.
   
   > **Note:** Customize your pen settings to match your writing style for optimal results.

## Annotate the Document

9. **Annotate the PDF**  
Use the active annotation tools to mark up your document:
   - Write, highlight, or underline text as needed.
   - **Add Bookmarks:**  
     - Tap the bookmark icon (represented by a ribbon) on the toolbar to bookmark the current page.  
     - To view or manage bookmarks, open the bookmark sidebar, where all your bookmarks are listed.
   - **Add Outlines:**  
     - If your imported PDF includes a built-in outline, GoodNotes will display it in the sidebar.  
     - If no outline exists, you can manually create one by using the text tool to add a table of contents or annotating a dedicated page to serve as your custom outline.
     
   > **Tip:** Using different colors or pen types for bookmarks and outline entries can help differentiate them and improve document navigation.

## Export the Annotated PDF

10. **Export the Annotated PDF**  
    Click the **“Share and Export”** icon and select the export options.  
    - Choose whether to export the current page or all pages.
    - Select your preferred format (e.g., PDF, image, or GoodNotes file).
    
    > **Success:** Your annotated PDF is now ready for sharing or backup.
