## How We Planned and Collaborated

Our journey with GoodNotes began when we started the CST program at BCIT, and neither of us had used a digital note-taking app before. We recognized the value of creating a guide that not only covers basic features but also introduces advanced functionalities we wish we had known earlier. This resource is intended to help users in both their academic and professional lives.

We collaborated through GitHub, navigating merge conflicts and integrating our work. We also communicated regularly over Discord for progress updates and feedback.

## How We Created This Guide

Our documentation is based on our hands-on experiences using GoodNotes with an iPad and Apple Pencil. As we experimented with the app, we discovered some features that we then integrated into our guide to help future users.

### Using MkDocs

Since developers are already familiar with Markdown, we discovered that MkDocs is a powerful tool for converting our Markdown files into a clean, static website. We used [MKDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), a framework built on MkDocs that offers a modern and user-friendly theme, to enhance the overall presentation of our documentation.

### Using Markdown

This documentation was written in Markdown, a primary markup language known for its simplicity and readability.

### Using Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code was our editor of choice for writing and editing the Markdown files. We used the terminal to serve and preview the site locally before publishing.
